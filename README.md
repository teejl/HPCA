# HPCA

This is the first course I have taken at Georgia Tech. It has been a challenging course thus far. It seemed to be very rigorous towards the middle of the semester around Branches. After this lesson it seemed like most of the projects were centered around this lesson, and it felt like an avalanche of material. It could also have felt stressful because of the vacations I took. This caused me to work around the clock on the weekends for the projects. Nonetheless, I learned alot from this course, and I would recommend this to anyone who is interested on how the motherboards work. 

The midterm was really understanding, but the final have a few curve ball questions. It threw me offgaurd that there were questions on some of the shorter lessons.
